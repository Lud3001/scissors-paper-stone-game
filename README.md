# A simple ancient game based on module "tkinter" and "random"
##  The game is played with the programme which chooses the option with random choice() method.
## Also the programme calculates the number of wins, looses and draws
#### It's my the very first project, so the aim was to try working with module tkinter and creating something interesting for users.
